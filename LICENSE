**ABSURDLY-OVERCOMPLICATED “DO WHATEVER YOU WANT” LICENSE (MIT-ish, lyrical parody edition — NOT ACTUALLY A LICENSE)**

Copyright (c) 2024 VectorReVamp

WHEREAS, a certain body of code, text, files, bytes, bugs, blessings, and bad decisions (collectively, the “Software,” meaning *this entire thing, whatever it is today and whatever it becomes after you poke it with a stick*) exists in the world; and

WHEREAS, you (the “Recipient,” “User,” “Entity,” “Carbon-Based Lifeform,” “Corporate Construct,” or “Other Legally Recognizable Arrangement of Intent”) have, by fate, forum, friend, fork, or frantic download, obtained a copy, clone, snapshot, archive, or other questionable embodiment thereof;

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of exactly **zero** (0) coins, credits, claps, kudos, or coupons, permission is hereby granted—free of charge, full send, no leash—to deal in the Software without restriction, including but not limited to the rights to:

* **use it, abuse it, refuse it, re-choose it, mis-use it, re-use it, overdo it, underdo it, then act brand-new like “who’d do it?” while you chewed it, screwed it, glued it, tattooed it, 2FA’d it, de-KMS’d it, hot-fixed it, bot-ticked it, zip-bombed it, git-wronged it, fork-fought it, port-brought it, script-spawned it, deps-drowned it, lint-shamed it, build-blamed it, ship-flamed it, rage-claimed it—then swear on your RAM you never even *touched* it, you just “viewed it,”**
* **copy it, crop it, drop it, desktop-pop it, paste it, misplaced it, then act shocked when you can’t retrace it,**
* **mod it, prod it, fork it, torque it, merge it, splurge it, rebase it, erase it, then swear you “saved” it,**
* **ship it, flip it, drip it, clip it—publish, distribute, sublicense, relicense, sell it, then bell it like you built it,**
* **pass it, blast it, hand it out, fan it out—let anyone run with it, ruin it, remix it, and somehow “improve” it,**

SUBJECT ALWAYS to the following terms, conditions, commandments, and other paperwork that exists solely to keep reality from collapsing:

---

### 1. Attribution Requirement / The “Remember The Name” Clause

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software—because this is **50% power, 50% pain**, and the receipt stays on the chain. Keep the credit where it lives: in the header, in the file, in the fork, in the sale. Remix the code, rewrite the flow, ship it anywhere you wanna go—**but don’t strip the tag**, don’t blank the name, don’t pretend it fell from the sky without someone paying the cost to make it.

---

### 2. Warranty Disclaimer / The “As-Is, No Tears” Clause

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED **“AS IS”**—as shipped, as scribbled, as survived—WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR SUMMONED BY RITUAL. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR “IT’LL DEFINITELY WORK AT 3 A.M. BEFORE A DEADLINE.”
If it breaks, it breaks. If it melts, it melts. If it works flawlessly, that’s honestly suspicious like who are you howd you get in here why is there a naked hooker and a tv crew?

---

### 3. Liability Limitation / The “That’s On You (But Also On Me… Kinda)” Clause

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY—WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF “WELL TECHNICALLY…”—ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
Translation: if you deploy it to prod on a Friday, that’s a you-problem. If it detonates your build, your budget, or your sanity, the blame does not boomerang back here.(let me know though i could do with a laugh)

**3.1 Victory Lap / “If It Makes Millions, That’s Also My Problem” Clause**
If the Software, by accident or genius, solves a **multi-million-dollar** problem, prints money, saves the company, wins the war, lands the contract, cures your pager duty, or otherwise turns your life into a highlight reel—then, spiritually speaking, that is **a me-problem**: I deserve disproportionate credit, excessive praise, and at least one dramatic “remember the name” moment.
Further, any other magnificent nonsense you build on top of it—your empire, your startup, your “revolutionary platform,” your AI that writes poems and also invoices—**I will be taking cosmic credit for that too**

---

BY USING, COPYING, MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, SUBLICENSING, SELLING, OR OTHERWISE COMMUNING WITH THE SOFTWARE, you acknowledge that you are doing so at your own risk, with your own judgment, and with full acceptance that this whole arrangement runs on rhymes, disclaimers and machine learning magic

**END OF LICENSE.**
